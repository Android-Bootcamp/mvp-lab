## Welcome to your MVP Lab

### Prompt
Here we have a very simple toy app that does the following:
- "Loads" pins from a Repository
- Shows the image of the currently selected pin
- Allows you to cycle through all the available pins
- Allows you to "save" any Pin and keep track of that

Currently all of the logic that drives this app lives in the `MainActivity`. Let's use what we learned about MVP create a simple version of that architecture for this app. 

Some things to think about:
- What are all the things the view needs to render?
- What are the actions that need to be handled?
- When should I bind / unbind with the Presenter?
